# ADR 007: Logging and Monitoring Approach

## Status

`Accepted`

## Context

We need a comprehensive logging and monitoring solution to track application performance, errors, and user activities across all modules.

## Decision

We will use Serilog for logging and integrate with Seq for log aggregation and analysis.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Structured logging with Serilog
- Centralized log management and analysis with Seq
- Easy to query and visualize logs

### Negative
- Additional setup and maintenance for Seq
- Potential cost for Seq licenses in production

## Example

```csharp
Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
    .WriteTo.Console()
    .WriteTo.Seq("http://localhost:5341")
    .CreateLogger();

Log.Information("Application {AppName} started", "BookFiesta");
```
