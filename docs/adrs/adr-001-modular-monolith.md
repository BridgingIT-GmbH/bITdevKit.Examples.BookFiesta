# ADR 001: Modular Monolith vs Microservices

## Status

`Accepted`

## Context

We need to decide on the overall architecture for the application. The main options are a modular monolith and a microservices architecture.

## Decision

We will implement the application as a modular monolith.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Simplified deployment and operations
- Easier development and testing
- Lower initial complexity
- Better performance for inter-module communication
- Easier refactoring and code sharing

### Negative

- Limited independent scalability
- Technology lock-in
- Potential for decreased development velocity in the long term

### Neutral

- Future migration path to microservices if needed
- Team organization flexibility
